###### The most effective and least expensive method of discovering new cures and treatments to diseases is to isolate and infect and/or market toxic chemicals to an immigrant Chinese-American boy on purpose, then gangstalk him while forcing him to look at WMAF

## Chainsmoking cigarettes until eye veins become inflammed as an alternative to marijuana for pain relief from Sotret 40mg side effects after Mom trusted the law and police and blamed marijuana for the June 2015 incident and enforce it by incessant yelling and blaming while never listening or able to comprehend me
Background: 
- YouTube, IBM co-worker, 4chan, Google, Facebook & Virginia Police tried to blame/frame a knife and marijuana for near fatal accident with dad
- On the day of the incident, I went to work but was very startled by seeing with my own eyes what Chordoma looked like, and the images & text produced not only emanated corruption and sadistic pleasure from the pain of others, but also deep fear into the depths of human suffering. At the IBM Reston, VA office a Chinese co-worker (G.W) gave me a choice between a "tian de" or "rou de" zongzi, a sweet or meat filled homemade rice snack, on the day of the incident, probably laced with some kind of hallucinogen such as angels trumpet/devil's breath/scopolamine/Hyoscine. I remember her touching me on the shoulder twice, but maybe it was out of concern since I was disturbed by the chordoma images.
- I was fascinated and felt special when it seemed like the nightcore rock[ with English lyrics making statements in a confident and forceful tone (and sounding good too)] YouTube music videos contained a scene where there was a white male, in some kind of business attire, about 12% body fat, with sadistic smile, zoomed into the 3 white dots in a triangle in his eyes, which I remembered were the same as the 3 white dots in a triangle inside of the lights of the police transport van as I was being transported from the mental evaluation clinic somewhere south of Virginia, back to the Fairfax jail in Vorthern Virginia, and they not only shackled my wrists, but also my ankles, which they tried to cut off during lunch at Edwards Elementary in Ames, Iowa when I was in 1st or 2nd grade.
- I began researching chordoma after magnesium discovery because the reason I started CureUC originally was to create a company to cure ulcerative colitis, inspired by the Chordoma story on Forbes
- I thought and believed they laced the food and drink with uranium after visiting OMF 2097 IRC chat and DarkUranium was a username there
- I concomitantly consumed ~50 magnesium citrate, strontium citrate, boron, calcium, and other pills to prevent uranium seeping into bones, causing chordoma
- Concomitantly, 4chan said "I just found out my dad has been cheating and raping my mom for the last 10 years" and after all this due to the YouTube, thought this was real
- Dad touched me with his stubble beard as he touched my hand with it as I tried to be asleep, and hit him with a disgust feeling elbow after believing what 4chan said was true, and that he would touch me with his beard stubble after that, combined with the targetted YouTube programming (I remember them using some kind of Naruto and nightcore music videos with lyrics that seemed like were true and directed at me, custom made
- I thought and believed that given if he used a knife back then, then that it was dad was going to use a knife and kill us all since he knew I knew what 4chan said, since my obese divorced non-stop loud gossip talking aunt said dad threatened to use a knife and kill her if she left him for someone else, but now even if mom says it was not true, i truly believed it was that way and she is helpless, penniless without a bank account and hopeless so she lies to me 
- Went upstairs, picked up a knife, mom told me to put them down, i put them down without confronting dad
- I thought and believed he was going to kill mom and I after he knew I knew he was cheating and raping her for 10 years since 4chan and YouTube were talking to me while the zongzi was possibly laced and charged at him with a knee (This was at IBM Reston, VA around June 2015)
- I believed and thought that now that the chordoma doctors knew that I knew they were causing cancer in patients on purpose for profit, they would make an example out of me by giving me chordoma by having the police inject me with chordoma

Results: Forced prison injection with sadistic smile physical witness, Permanent weight gain, lethargy, rectal pain and bleeding, cigarettes no longer feel like how they used to

## Tsetsi medicinal leech as a spot cure to reactivated chickenpox misdiagnosed as acne during high school
Background: 
- Gmail advertisement of purchaseable leeches on leeches.com or tsetsi.com on Google and Gmail
- Around the time they kept parading WMAF & BMAF and all types of XMAF in my periperal view as I went to work, to rub salt on my inability to sustain comfort with beautiful, cute, intelligent, good asian girls, without extremes in social settings, from years of blood, isolation and rejection (from Sotret mostly, but even in middle school, the majority of Asian girls all seemed to only truly desire a white boy/guy)

Results: After being yelled at for trying to hold a Chinese girl's hand but her staying silent when a random white male with a beard and orange hair touched her chest, after being bit on the right thigh as an experiment from the rejection/rebound effect, there is a daily non-stop remote controlled musclar twitching in a sexual harassment way (non stop twitching of glutes, calves, thighs, knees, and other parts of my body) & other possible damage, varying intensity and length, from extreme discomfort, to mild interest, as I remember on 3/14 of the year gangstalked and cripple parade Stephen Hawking died

## Nightly 40mg Sotret{Indian generic of Original Brand} (Accutane{Original Brand} (isotretinoin{Chemical name}) biosimilar manufactured by Ranbaxy, an Indian pharmaceutical company) as a cure to reactivated chickenpox misdiagnosed as acne after high school but before starting college for about a year, nightly adherence like a religion due to not only previously trusting everyone at first, always, as suggested by freshman biology teacher Mr. Charnitski at TJHSST of Alexandria, VA (who looks like Adam Back and Uncle Sam), but also from personal belief and faith of the excellence and superiority of American doctors, their science, biology, and medicine [in hindsight, seems like there is a fraudulent eugenics agenda against Asian phenotypes based on conflicting standards of beauty and health, as they are excluded from music, movies, books and other positive media]
Background: 
- Peer & majority encouraged non-vaccinated Chickenpox infection from Edwards Elementary school in Ames, Iowa mimicing acne
- Accutane advertisement w/ medical illustrations/art on top shelf in Dr. Robert Gurney's dermatology office of Reston, VA
- 4 years of peer rejection at TJHSST, especially from Asian girls and white boys
- public humiliation in front of people multiple times at the public schools, including the spelling bee to large audiences, and to individuals
- my aunt's tone of telling me that no girl would ever love me or want to be with me after the teacher, peer & majority rejection from high school after seeing the results of self surgery on a butt acne with sewing needle and 70% isopropyl alcohol, or just a safety pin and hot water/flame as disinfectant instead of a lancet and betadine/povidone iodine)
- cigarette smoking and bleeding hollow world of warcraft, lymph node stagnation, no kicking bags, kicking air, jumping or olympic weightlifting discovered or allowed
- forced gangstalked HIV speaker/fraud presentation (they did this to me at TJHSST) speech before graduation
- health class was taught by trailer white hag
- Mr. Charnitski made us watch a live birth video of an obese degenerate pregnant woman with grey tinted skin and uncut genital hair in his class, which was based on memorization, forced reading and pop quizes as he yelled at me in front of the whole class when I was falling asleep in his lecture class based on us gaining his trust and forcing his authority by holding grades hostage

Results: Eyebrows fell out first week of taking it after high school, endless depression and sadness, dry skin, permanantly thinned hair, skin wounds heal with scars, proctosigmoiditis with bleeding, tenesmus, constipation and up to 5 BMs/day


-Qihan/Harry Zhang

I remember them lightly shocking my penis head even before the medical leeches and jail when they forced a social situation with me and a white girl, unnatural racemixing agenda, it felt good, the shock, bc it was light, narrow/thin and had distance/circumference, but that also means they put these sexual implants on my body without my consent, making me feel not even entitled to my own physical body, like an animal
