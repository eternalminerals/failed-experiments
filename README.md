## Tsetsi medicinal leech as a spot cure to reactivated chickenpox misdiagnosed as acne during high school
Background: 
- Gmail advertisement of purchaseable leeches on leeches.com or tsetsi.com on Google and Gmail
- Around the time they kept parading WMAF & BMAF and all types of XMAF in my periperal view as I went to work, to rub salt on my inability to sustain comfort with beautiful, cute, intelligent, good asian girls, without extremes in social settings, from years of blood, isolation and rejection (from Sotret mostly, but even in middle school, the majority of Asian girls all seemed to only truly desire a white boy/guy)

Results: After being yelled at for trying to hold a Chinese girl's hand but her staying silent when a random white male with a beard and orange hair touched her chest, after being bit on the right thigh as an experiment from the rejection/rebound effect, there is a remote controlled musclar twitching & other possible damage, varying intensity and length, from extreme discomfort, to mild interest, as I remember on 3/14 of the year gangstalked and cripple parade Stephen Hawking died

## Nightly 40mg Sotret{Indian generic of Original Brand} (Accutane{Original Brand} (isotretinoin{Chemical name}) biosimilar manufactured by Ranbaxy, an Indian pharmaceutical company) as a cure to reactivated chickenpox misdiagnosed as acne after high school but before starting college for about a year, nightly adherence like a religion due to not only previously trusting everyone at first, always, as suggested by freshman biology teacher Mr. Charnitski at TJHSST of Alexandria, VA (who looks like Adam Back and Uncle Sam), but also from personal belief and faith of the excellence and superiority of American doctors, their science, biology, and medicine [in hindsight, seems like there is a fraudulent eugenics agenda against Asian phenotypes based on conflicting standards of beauty and health, as they are excluded from music, movies, books and other positive media]
Background: 
- Peer & majority encouraged non-vaccinated Chickenpox infection from Edwards Elementary school in Ames, Iowa mimicing acne
- Accutane advertisement w/ medical illustrations/art on top shelf in Dr. Robert Gurney's dermatology office of Reston, VA
- 4 years of peer rejection at TJHSST, especially from Asian girls and white boys
- my aunt's tone of telling me that no girl would ever love me or want to be with me after the teacher, peer & majority rejection from high school after seeing the results of self surgery on a butt acne with sewing needle and 70% isopropyl alcohol, or just a safety pin and hot water/flame as disinfectant instead of a lancet and betadine/povidone iodine)
- cigarette smoking and bleeding hollow world of warcraft, lymph node stagnation, no kicking bags, kicking air, jumping or olympic weightlifting discovered or allowed
- forced gangstalked HIV speaker/fraud presentation (they did this to me at TJHSST) speech before graduation
- health class was taught by trailer white hag
- Mr. Charnitski made us watch a live birth video of an overweight pregnant woman with grey tinted skin and uncut genital hair in his class, which was based on memorization, forced reading and pop quizes as he yelled at me in front of the whole class when I was falling asleep in his lecture class based on us gaining his trust and forcing his authority by holding grades hostage

Results: Eyebrows fell out first week of taking it after high school, endless depression and sadness, dry skin, permanantly thinned hair, skin wounds heal with scars, proctosigmoiditis with bleeding, tenesmus, constipation and up to 5 BMs/day
